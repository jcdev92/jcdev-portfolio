  aboutMe:
    "Greetings my name is Jesus Clemente, I'm  a Full Stack Developer with passion for creating beautiful and functional web apps.",
  biography:
    "My interest in computers began when I was around 15 years old, when I taught myself how to repair computers. Then years later I studied business administration at university, with the dream of creating my own IT company. However, it was only after different jobs, years later, that I discovered the fascinating world of code on the Internet.  To have a solid foundation, I studied the fundamentals of programming at Platzi Academy. Next, I enrolled in Academlo, an invaluable opportunity to learn more about web development. At Academlo, I developed applications with JavaScript-HTML CSS, REACT & NODE JS, such as an online store, Poke-App, CRUD users App, and several dynamic websites. Now, I want to use my skills to help others achieve their aspirations.",
